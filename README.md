# Compressed Video Generation Example
This is an example to generate compressed video using h264 codec.  
You can test how powerful this codec is.  If things move less in each frames, video will be compressed to tiny size.

## Library
Perhaps, you need to download `OpenH264` library.  
Download it from https://github.com/cisco/openh264/releases .  
Carefully check your error message and find out which version of library is needed.
